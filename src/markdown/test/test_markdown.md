# My first post on the new website!

## How does it feel?

It feels pretty good to be redoing my website. I liked hugo for its ease of use, but after doing my web development bootcamp at concordia university, hugo is somewhat limiting in terms of what I can do

## What's next for the blog?

1. New programatic table of contents for article
2. LaTeX support for math notes
3. nifty css gags

### What's here to stay?

- All the old articles you know and love
- Pixel art
- Dark theme
